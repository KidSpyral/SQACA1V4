# Code Reviews

## Introduction
In the Second  part of this handbook, we will be discussing Code Reviews and we’ll mention some good code review  practices that we expect all current and future employees to follow. Firstly, we will discuss what code reviews is and why it is important.Code reviews are an essential aspect of the software development lifecycle. It involves the examination of a programmer’s code by their peers to identify and rectify errors, improve code quality and ensure compliance with coding standards. This process helps maintain code integrity and leads to the creation of robust, reliable and efficient software.Code reviwing is important because  developers scrutinise each other’s code, looking for potential bugs, performance issues and adherence to best practices. This collaborative approach encourages knowledge sharing and helps maintain a high level of code quality throughout the project.

## Common Themes

•	Following Coding Standards         

•	Scheduling and Allocating Time

•	Setting Clear Objectives

•	Documentation quality

•	Communication


## Following Coding Standards 

Another challenge in code review is how to ensure that the code follows consistent standards and best practices, such as coding style, naming conventions, documentation, testing, and security. To overcome this challenge, you should establish and document the code standards and best practices for your project or team and make sure everyone is aware of them. Additionally, you can use tools like code linters, style guides, or checklists to help enforce and verify the standards. Furthermore, review the code against the standards and best practices and point out any deviations or violations. Provide suggestions on how to fix or improve the code according to the standards; tools like code analyzers, code formatters, or code quality metrics can help
### Challenges

## Scheduling and Allocating Time
Time constraints can lead to pressure and stress for both reviewers and developers. To address this challenge, prioritize and plan the code review tasks, allocating more time and attention to important, urgent, or risky changes. Utilize tools like code review platforms, issue trackers, or project management tools for organization and tracking. Additionally, encourage developers to submit small, incremental, and well-defined code changes rather than large, monolithic ones.


### Challenges
### Communication issues

One of the main challenges in code review is how to communicate effectively with the developers, especially when giving feedback or suggesting changes. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, or demotivation, so to ensure successful communication, you should adhere to some basic principles. Respect and constructive criticism should be the foundation of any code review, so avoid personal attacks, sarcasm, or harsh criticism. Additionally, be as specific and clear as possible when giving feedback and suggestions; explain your reasoning and provide examples or references if possible.



### Challenges

## Personal Experiences
#### Lack of Documentation
The most common issue I have seen is lack of documentation and comments with the code. Each developer has their own way of implementing the logic and lack of docs & comments lead to confusion for the reviewer if they had a different implementation in mind.  And hence both reviewer and developer has to put in more effort and time to clear out the doubts and confusion. There are a lot of AI tools available today that would generate documentation based on your code which we can use in day to day life to mitigate this problem.
