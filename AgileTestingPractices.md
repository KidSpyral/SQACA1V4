In the last part of this handbook, we will be discussing agile testing and we’ll mention some good agile testing practices that we expect all current and future employees to follow. Firstly, we will discuss what agile testing is and why it is important. Agile testing is a methodology that helps developers test their code continuously and rapidly and in agile testing, there are various roles and responsibilities of different team members. The main principles include: early and continuous testing, whole team approach, frequent deliveries, close collaboration, customer involvement, working software and flexible approach. All this is important because it helps to ensure that software meets the needs of the customer (n.d).
Through research we have the best practices for agile testing:
•	Early and Continuous testing
Early in the development cycle, start testing. Throughout the course of the development cycle, they should also regularly test the program.

•	Collaboration and communication
Encourage cooperation amongst stakeholders, testers, and developers and keep lines of communication open to help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no surprises.
•	Test automation
Give automation of important and repetitive test cases first priority. For efficiency, use automated testing techniques.
•	Cross-functional teams
Create multidisciplinary teams with a range of expertise and encourage team members to work together.
•	Adaptability to change
Accept alterations in needs and priorities and modify plans and test cases as necessary.
•	Test environment management
Keep test environments configured to closely resemble production. Make sure that the testing and development environments work together effectively.
•	Risk-based testing
Sort testing projects according to risk assessment. Determine which locations are at high risk and then devote testing resources to them.
