# Agile Testing Practices 

## Introduction
In the last part of this handbook, we will be discussing Agile Testing and we’ll mention some good agile testing practices that we expect all current and future employees to follow. Firstly, we will discuss what agile testing is and why it is important. Agile testing is a methodology that helps developers test their code continuously and rapidly and in agile testing, there are various roles and responsibilities of different team members. The main principles include: early and continuous testing, whole team approach, frequent deliveries, close collaboration, customer involvement, working software and flexible approach. All this is important because it helps to ensure that software meets the needs of the customer (n.d).
Through research we have the best practices for agile testing.

## Common Themes

•	Exploratory Testing                                                

•	Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

•	Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

## Exploratory Testing

Using a strategy that emphasizes learning, adaption, and exploration, exploratory testers simultaneously develop and run test cases. 

### Challenges
• One of the primary challenges in exploratory testing is the balance between planning and learning. While ET is less structured than traditional testing, it still requires a level of planning to be effective. 

• Testers in an exploratory setting often deal with context switches. They must juggle different aspects of the software, switch between various tasks, and respond to new findings in real-time.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

The techniques of continuous deployment (CD) and continuous integration (CI) make guarantee that code updates are automatically tested, built, and put into production settings.

### Challenges
• Ownership-Based CI/CD: Often bugs and code errors are identified at a later stage of the DevOps release cycle. Sometimes, CI/CD pipeline even fails or breaks down due to these bugs.

• Limited Environment Challenges: Software development teams, especially testers, often get only limited infrastructure resources to test their code. In such scenarios, teams tend to incline towards a shared testing environment.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

A cooperative method of developing software, behavior-driven development (BDD) promotes dialogue among developers, quality assurance (QA), and business stakeholders.

### Challenges
• One of the primary challenges in adopting BDD is resistance to change. Teams may be accustomed to traditional development methods, and introducing a new paradigm requires a shift in mindset.

• BDD promotes collaboration between technical and non-technical team members, emphasizing shared understanding and communication. However, achieving this level of collaboration can be challenging, especially when team members are accustomed to working in silos

## Personal Experiences
#### Resistance to Change
Agile testing frequently faces resistance since it can be difficult to break old habits and viewpoints. We have an individual, based on first-hand experience and narrative, who during a pivotal moment in their career occurred when they managed an engineering team that resisted automated testing, perceiving it as solely within the domain of QA. However, after insisting on its implementation and facing initial pushback, a notable transformation ensued. Not only did code quality improve, but even the most steadfast opponent of automated testing became its most fervent advocate in the face of failing tests. This experience highlighted the transformative power of embracing change and establishing new patterns. Despite the challenges of transition, the long-term benefits in efficiency and quality far outweighed the initial discomfort, prompting reflection on why such practices weren't adopted sooner.


#### Culture
 Any methodology will only work if the culture cultivates it. That means support from upper management & buy-in from the key stakeholders. Anything less will result in a sub-par implementation, which often ends up getting the methodology / process scrapped altogether. I’ve been in places where neither the buy in or the support were there. The organization ended up thinking Agile was the issue, but in reality it was the culture.


 #### Industry
 Some industries can never be fully 100% agile. Mostly for two reasons: regulations and cost. Industries in the heavily regulated space and industries where margins are razor thin cannot afford to adopt the “fail early, fail often” motto when it comes to projects. It’s “measure twice, cut once”. In some of my previous positions, I’ve had to run projects where everything has to be precisely planned due to industry downturns & margin level (very small budget variance allowed), and where everything has to have corresponding processes and documented for compliance.
