Each person has to work on each assigned branch first and push/pull and the corressponding person working on the document will take over annd add updates and this will be the process.

There has been 2 members assigned to work on each document and the entire group will make an executive decision on each file and decide whether it is complete.

# Team Evaluation

## What went well:
• We were able to get a clear and concise project plan that each member understood and was able to follow.

• We were able to get a cohesive document structure across each topic.

• Consistent meetings to get members on the same page and to identify task that needed to be done and fixed.

• We had a clear branching model.

## What we would do differently:

• Ensure clearer and more descriptive branch names to improve understanding and organization.

• Encourage team members to make smaller, more focused commits to facilitate easier code review and rollback if necessary.

• Implement a stricter code review process to catch issues earlier and improve code quality.

• Foster better communication among team members, ensuring everyone is aware of project updates, changes, and blockers.

• Follow the correct GitFlow Process as  we had to create mulitple project because we did not
